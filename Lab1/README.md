# SI LAB.1

For this laboratory work I created a tcp and a udp server and a client for both servers.

It is possible to send data from client to both servers by the flag that is putted before message.
I created a -get method for obtaing the web page.
By putting the -s flag it is possible to scan a server for open ports.
